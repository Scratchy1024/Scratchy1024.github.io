  <div class="content">
    <p>We’re making a change to the Mutated Public Events playlist by adding five public events each with two mutations to the playlist. </p>
    <p>These events are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Campfire Tales: Volatile and Toxic Blood Mutations </li>
      <li>Free Range: Resilient and Swift-Footed Mutations </li>
      <li>Project Paradise: Active Camouflage and Resilient Mutations </li>

    <h3 id="perksupdate">Perks Update</h3>
  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>During Milepost Zero PTS testing and release, we made some focused changes to Vaccinated, Iron Stomach, Thirst Quencher, and Natural Resistance perks to make these generally underperforming cards more interesting and easier to incorporate into your builds. We did this by removing the extra ranks, lowering the cards cost, and changing the card’s effect to scale with the related primary stat. </p>
    <p>In today’s PTS update, we’re continuing this process by modifying more Perk cards with the same design goals in mind. This batch of changes primarily focuses on Endurance cards, but you’ll also see some changes to a few cards in the other stat categories. </p>

    <p>We’ve reduced the radius in which screen flash effects appear for a multitude of explosions throughout the game. This is purely a visual change and does not impact the radius in which damage is dealt except in the couple of cases noted below. </p>
    <p>A few of these have had sizeable reductions (especially Fatman and Fatman MIRV explosions).

    <p>We have made changes to Damage and AP Costs for many weapons which primarily focuses on improving cases where weapons don’t perform well enough to meet players’ expectations. </p>
    <h4 id="damagebuffs">Damage Buffs</h4>
    <p>These values represent the weapon at its maximum level (45 or 50, depending on the weapon). Lower-level values have similar increases in damage. </p>
    <p>This list represents an early pass on many non-automatic and single-shot weapons, including Shotguns, Revolvers, Rifles, and Bows. Please be sure to provide feedback on these changes as we intend to make follow-up adjustments as needed. </p>
    <p>Damage for the following weapons has been increased: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>10mm Pistol: 28 -&gt; 31 </li>
      <li>44 (Revolver): 60 -&gt; 72 </li>

      <li>Bow: 90 -&gt; 95 </li>
      <li>Cold Shoulder: 115/75 -&gt; 91/91 </li>
      <li>Combat Shotgun: 90 -&gt; 97 </li>

      <li>Gauss Rifle: 140 -&gt; 146 </li>
      <li>Gauss Shotgun: 140 -&gt; 187 </li>
      <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: We recognize that the initial update to the Gauss Shotgun (originally 105 -&gt; 140) was not sufficient in making up for damage lost with the earlier change to how explosions’ damage is calculated. We’ll continue to observe this weapon’s performance and will make further updates if needed to ensure that it meets expectations. </li>
      <li>Harpoon Gun: 175 -&gt; 195 </li>
      <li>Hunting Rifle: 70 -&gt; 100 </li>
      <li>Lever Action Rifle: 75 -&gt; 88 </li>

      <li>Western Revolver: 65 -&gt; 84 </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="weaponmodadjustments">Weapon Mod Adjustments</h4>
    <p>Adjusted the damage for the Beta Wave Tuner and Gamma Wave Emitter mods for the following weapons: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Laser Gun </li>
      <li>Reduced DoT damage </li>
      <li>Reduced fire damage </li>
      <li>Ultracite Laser Gun </li>
      <li>Reduced DoT damage </li>
      <li>Reduced fire damage </li>
      <li>Gatling Laser </li>
      <li>Increased DoT damage </li>
      <li>Reduced fire damage </li>
      <li>Ultracite Gatling Laser </li>
      <li>Reduced DoT damage at level 35 </li>
      <li>Reduced fire damage </li>
      <li>Plasma Gun </li>
      <li>Reduced DoT damage </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Dev Note</strong>: While these weapons are still being evaluated for overall balance, these particular mods over-shot the current target for fire damage mods (especially when taking into account the recent adjustments to creature health and resistances) and are being brought in line with similar mods for other weapons. This allows for more consistency among weapons and mods when making future changes. </p>

      <li>Dev Note: The effect of this mutation was originally reduced in an earlier update, but the effect of the Mutation with the Strange in Numbers version perk had not been updated at that time. This change brings Eagle Eyes in line with expectations for how Strange in Numbers affects mutations. </li>
      <li>Addressed an issue where the increased hunger/thirst penalty of the Speed Demon mutation had no effect. </li>
      <li>Addressed an issue where the effects of the Class Freak perk, the Speed Demon Serum's impact on negative mutation effects, and RadX's effect on suppressing the effects of Speed Demon were not properly represented in the Pip-Boy. </li>
      <li>Addressed an issue where the Speed Demon mutation would also count as the Empath mutation for reducing damage dealt to teammates. </li>
      <li>Dev Note: Alongside the other Empath bugs, this was causing a 33% reduction in all damage taken and a further 33% reduction to explosion damage taken while on a team – so long as a fellow teammate was using the Speed Demon mutation. </li>
      <li>Addressed an issue where the Empath mutation's damage reduction for teammates was twice as effective as intended for explosion damage. </li>
      <li>Addressed an issue the Empath mutation's increase to damage taken would cause twice as much additional explosion damage as expected. </li>

  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>These enemies previously shared weapons with players and now use enemy-specific variants of those weapons. As a result, these weapons can no-longer be looted after those enemies are killed. To make up for the loss of these items, we’ll be making adjustments to creature loot and scrap-to-learn chance for non-legendary mods in a later update during this PTS. </p>
    <p>The types of health, damage, and resistance adjustments mentioned in the creatures below have also been applied to other creatures as part of earlier updates. We’ve included additional information here to help provide a better understanding of the changes being made. </p>
    <p>Balance adjustments have been made for the following creatures: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All creatures previously using player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners, Raiders, Scorched, Super Mutants): </li>
      <li>Weapon damage now scales to level 100. </li>
      <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: As these creatures previously used player weapons, their damage would only scale to level 45 or 50. </li>
      <li>Thrown grenades now scale with level. </li>
      <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: This currently only applies to enemies using grenades. Damage from player grenades is unchanged. </li>
      <li>Health, resistances, and damage now scale more smoothly from level 1 to level 100. </li>
      <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: These creatures will generally be less threatening at mid-level (especially 35-75) but should be a bit tougher towards level 100. In some cases at lower level, these creatures may be slightly weaker or stronger in order to ensure that they’re appropriately engaging even when first met. </li>
      <li>Power Armor variants’ resistances now scale more appropriately at differing levels. </li>
      <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: These creatures previously would gain a flat bonus from Power Armor at all levels and thus could be unexpectedly tough at low-to-mid level. </li>
      <li>Resistances differentiated between Blood Eagles, Cultists, and Raiders. </li>
      <li>Now relies more on health as the primary driver of survivability rather than resistances. </li>
      <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: Resistances are being used to differentiate damage types rather than as a substitute for health. This has the side benefit of showing higher damage numbers when attacking these creatures which more closely match the weapons being used. </li>
      <li>No-longer gains a variable amount of resistances based on randomized armor. </li>
      <li>Floater Freezer </li>
      <li>Slightly lowered the duration of the slow effect on the freezing breath attack. </li>
      <li>Reduced the rate at which the slow effect accumulates for the freezing breath attack. </li>
      <li>Reduced damage for the freezing breath attack. </li>
      <li>Reduced the cryo damage for the blast/stare/shockwave attack (the one which also deals fusion core damage). </li>
      <li>Floater Flamer </li>
      <li>Reduced damage for the fire breath attack. </li>
      <li>Floater gnasher </li>
      <li>Reduced damage for the bite attack. </li>
      <li>Alien Invader </li>
      <li>Reduced health </li>

    <p>Magazines </p>
    <p>The following Magazines have been updated. For the most part, these are direct increases to the Magazines’ effects. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Astoundingly Awesome Tales 7: +25 max AP, up from +5. </li>
      <li>Astoundingly Awesome Tales 10: +35% more damage with scoped weapons while aiming, previously +15% without needing to aim. </li>
      <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: This magazine now specifically offers its benefit to weapons fired using manual aim and does not affect VATS. </li>
      <li>Backwoodsman 2: Name and cover art updated to match effect. </li>
      <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: This is a purely cosmetic change for the magazine’s name and cover. It was previously swapped with Backwoodsman 7 (see below). </li>
      <li>Backwoodsman 6: Now only affects healing from cooked foods, rather than all effects from cooked food. </li>
      <li>Backwoodsman 7 (name and cover art updated to match effect): Now affects all thrown weapons (Sheepsquatch Shard, Tomahawk, Throwing Knife, Meat Cleaver) instead of just Tomahawks. </li>
      <li>Live and Love 1: +25 max HP while on a team, up from 10. </li>
      <li>Live and Love 3: Now only affects healing from fruits &amp; veggies, rather than all effects from fruits &amp; veggies. </li>
      <li>Live and Love 6: +25 damage resistance while on a team, up from 10. </li>
      <li>Grognak the Barbarian 3: +25 poison resistance, up from 15. </li>
      <li>Grognak the Barbarian 8: +25 cryo resistance (Charisma no-longer required), instead of +2 damage resistance per point of Charisma. </li>
      <li>Grognak the Barbarian 9: +25 carry weight, up from +10. </li>
      <li>Grognak the Barbarian 10: +25 energy resistance, up from +15. </li>
      <li>Tesla Science 6: +75 radiation resistance, up from +15. </li>
      <li>Guns and Bullets 6: +75 damage resistance at night, up from +10 damage resistance at night. </li>
      <li>Now occurs slightly later at night to match Nocturnal and other night-time effects. </li>
      <li>Scout's Life 3: Now reduces all items' weight by 10%, instead of +10 carry weight. </li>
      <li>Scout's Life 9: Now provides +25 fire resistance, instead of -80% camp placement cost. </li>
      <li>US Covert operations Manual 1: +50 damage resistance while sneaking, up from +10 while sneaking. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Backwoodsman 6 and Live and Love 3 far exceeded the intended level of benefit for magazines and have been adjusted to match their original effect of boosting Healing from food items. Backwoodsman 6’s prior change in the Once in a Blue Moon update had been made in error, and we apologize for the confusion. </p>
    <p>Prior to this update, these magazines boosted all foods effects, including (but not limited) to Carry Weight, S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats, VATS Critical Attack damage, etc. </p>
    <p>The effects of these magazines will be further adjusted if needed in future updates. </p>

  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <ul>
      <li>Addressed an issue where Super Mutant Suiciders wouldn't drop mini-nukes. They now have a small chance to drop a mini-nuke when killed without exploding. </li>
      <li>Addressed an issue where the Health and Resistances for the Scorchbeast Queen, Ultracite Titan, and Wendigo Colossus/Earle weren’t using updated values. </li>
      <li>Addressed an issue where Shotgun durability was much higher than expected as a result of an <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4nMJ3QEIKoK16nZ0A8P7Ec/fallout-76-inventory-update-notes-january-26-2021">earlier change</a>. </li>
      <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: Shotguns previously would lose durability per-pellet instead of per-shot, and shotgun durability had not yet been updated to match the much-lower durability impact after the change. Please be sure to provide feedback on this change, especially if you feel that Shotguns no-longer have durability that’s comparable to other weapons. </li>
      <li>Addressed an issue where NPCs using Laser Rifles can occasionally deal unexpectedly high damage. </li>
      <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: This occurred when those NPCs were using Laser Rifles with Sniper barrels which will charge over time when not being fired in order to deal more damage on the next shot. These mods have been removed from NPC-specific Laser Rifles. </li>
      <li>Addressed an issue where Tormentor perk had no effect for automatic weapons. </li>
      <li>Addressed an issue where weapons other than Shotguns could be affected by the Enforcer perk in specific circumstances. </li>
