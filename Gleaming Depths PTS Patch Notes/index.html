<div class="update bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41 heading_md article-el-h3">The
  Gleaming Depths Raid</div>
<div class="paragraph">The Gleaming Depths raid is a new endgame activity designed to be faced
  by a party of four highly leveled and geared players. Each encounter is going to require
  your party to work together to overcome unique coop mechanics to overcome the bosses within.
  These bosses may also punish some types of character builds and we’re sure you’ll figure out
  which builds are more advantageous for each fight. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Unlike Daily Ops and Expeditions, which can be cleared solo if you have
  the correct build, the Gleaming Depths will require you and your squad to take on unique
  roles during the encounters and communicate with each other. To help facilitate
  communication, we’re also introducing a contextual Ping system to allow those who may not
  feel comfortable with being on voice comms to assist the team. When pointed towards a
  target, the ping system will mark hostile and friendly targets, points of interest, and
  containers.</div>
<div class="paragraph">When designing this activity, the team laid out five core features that
  will make raids different than other repeatable content like Daily Ops, Expeditions or World
  Bosses:</div>
<ul>
  <li>Require Teamwork</li>
  <li>Challenge Endgame Builds</li>
  <li>Unique Boss Fights</li>
  <li>No Time Gating</li>
  <li>High Value Rewards</li>
</ul>
<div class="paragraph">We’ve covered the first three bullet points in the opening paragraphs so
  now let’s cover the last two.</div>
<div class="paragraph">No time gating. Raids can be completed back-to-back without having to
  wait for a reset timer. With each encounter you clear you get rewards. This is important
  because completing these raid encounters will be your primary source of 4-Star Legendary
  Mods/Items as well as other raid related rewards.</div>
<div class="paragraph">To start the questline, go to the Gleaming Depths location in the Ash
  Heap (there’s a new Raid Map Marker to help guide you). Form your party of four and then
  enter the raid through the Ultracite Fissure. </div>
<div class="miner-note"><strong>Miner Note</strong>: 4 players are not explictly required to start a raid, your mileage
  may vary.</div>
<div class="paragraph">If you run into any issues and need to restart the questline follow these
  steps: Pip Boy &gt; Data &gt; Gleaming Depths &gt; Reject. After that, reenter the Gleaming
  Depths to pick the quest back up. </div>
<div class="paragraph">P.S. We’re aware that we’ve said nothing about the ACTUAL raid bosses.
  That’s because we want you to experience that for yourself! </div>
<div class="paragraph">If you’re someone who likes to record their gameplay, we’d love to see
  your first experience. Record it and tag @Fallout on X (formerly Twitter) so we can watch
  your clear. Surely, you’re going to one-shot it, right?</div>
<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41  heading_md article-el-h3">
  4-Star Legendary Items (And ENEMIES!)</div>
<div class="paragraph">With the release of the Gleaming Depths, we are expanding the current
  legendary system to take your 3-Star items and allow you turn them into 4-Star items.
  Opening a whole new avenue for you to modify your weapons and armor in ways that amplify
  your playstyle. </div>

<div class="paragraph">This all ties into the Legendary Crafting system that was introduced in
  Milepost Zero. If you have 4-Star Legendary Weapons and Armor, you’ll have a chance at
  obtaining a loose mod or learning the recipe when you scrap the item. Like Three-Star Mods,
  loose 4-Star Mods can be traded with other players. But the second you craft it on an item,
  that item becomes untradeable and you cannot drop it. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Combine the introduction of 4-Star Legendary items with the introduction
  of Raids and this is the largest expansion to our endgame yet!</div>

  with a nickname that suits you! Earnable from participating in Public Events, Limited Time
  Events, completing Main Quests, and Seasons, these unique titles will help you stand out
  from the crowd. The Gleaming Depths raid will also have its own set of titles that will be
  tied to Challenges. </div>
<div class="paragraph">For long-time players, any titles that are associated to content that
  you’ve already completed will be automatically granted to your account.</div>

<div class="paragraph">Say hello to two new fuzzy friends who will help bring your C.A.M.P, to life! We’re
  excited to bring C.A.M.P. Pets to Fallout 76 starting with a Cat and a Dog. And yes, you can pet them.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">You can find your C.A.M.P. Pet in the newly updated DWELLERS workshop tab and spawn
  them by placing the corresponding spawning furniture for the cat or dog - a cat bed and a doghouse. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Once placed, the animals will follow you around your C.A.M.P., idly walk, sit in their
  furniture and use their own cat scratcher or digging in their doggy bone mound. The latter furniture items
  must be placed before they will use them, and currently are found in the MISC workshop tab. </div>
<div class="paragraph">C.A.M.P. Pets will not follow you in the world - they are just that - a C.A.M.P. pet!
  You cannot have more than one at a time, but you can have one pet and one ally in your C.A.M.P.. They will
  not, however, be available in your Shelter. </div>
<div class="paragraph">To interact with your new friend, walk up to them and press the interaction buttons
  that you see when they are close. "Interact" for Pet Commands, "Customize" for Dress Up, and "Edit Name" to
  call them what you'd like (other players will NOT see your pet's name). </div>
<div class="paragraph">Through Pet Commands you can have them sit, speak, and of course, pet them through an
  emote style window. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Dress up your pet by crafting their collars at the Armor Workbench in the Headwear
  section, then use the "Customize" interaction to place them on your friend. </div>
<div class="paragraph">As well as being a cute dweller in your C.A.M.P., they will also bring you an item
  every so often! This Pet Treasure system allows your fuzzy friend to show their love for you by bringing you
  a little treat! </div>
<div class="miner-note"><strong>Miner Note</strong>: Gifts currently include random 1* legendary gear, 1* legendary
  mods, and 2-5 legendary scrip.

<div class="paragraph">During Milepost Zero PTS testing and release, we made some focused changes to
  Vaccinated, Iron Stomach, Thirst Quencher, and Natural Resistance perks to make these generally
  underperforming cards more interesting and easier to incorporate into your builds. We did this by removing
  the extra ranks, lowering the cards cost, and changing the card’s effect to scale with the related primary
  stat. </div>
<div class="paragraph">In today’s PTS update, we’re continuing this process by modifying more Perk cards with
  the same design goals in mind. This batch of changes primarily focuses on Endurance cards, but you’ll also
  see some changes to a few cards in the other stat categories. </div>

<div class="paragraph">These enemies previously shared weapons with players and now use enemy-specific variants of
  those
  weapons. As a result, these weapons can no-longer be looted after those enemies are killed. To make up for the
  loss of
  these items, we’ll be making adjustments to creature loot and scrap-to-learn chance for non-legendary mods in a
  later
  update during this PTS. </div>
<div class="paragraph">The types of health, damage, and resistance adjustments mentioned in the creatures below have
  also been applied to other creatures as part of earlier updates. We’ve included additional information here to
  help
  provide a better understanding of the changes being made. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Balance adjustments have been made for the following creatures: </div>
<ul>
  <li>All creatures previously using player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners, Raiders, Scorched,
    Super
    Mutants):
    <ul>
      <li>Weapon damage now scales to level 100.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: As these creatures previously used player weapons, their damage would only
            scale to level 45 or 50.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Thrown grenades now scale with level.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: This currently only applies to enemies using grenades. Damage from player
            grenades is unchanged.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Health, resistances, and damage now scale more smoothly from level 1 to level 100.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: These creatures will generally be less threatening at mid-level (especially
            35-75) but should be a bit tougher towards level 100. In some cases at lower level, these creatures may
            be
            slightly weaker or stronger in order to ensure that they’re appropriately engaging even when first met.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Power Armor variants’ resistances now scale more appropriately at differing levels.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: These creatures previously would gain a flat bonus from Power Armor at all
            levels and thus could be unexpectedly tough at low-to-mid level.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Resistances differentiated between Blood Eagles, Cultists, and Raiders.</li>
      <li>Now relies more on health as the primary driver of survivability rather than resistances.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: Resistances are being used to differentiate damage types rather than as a
            substitute for health. This has the side benefit of showing higher damage numbers when attacking these
            creatures which more closely match the weapons being used.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
