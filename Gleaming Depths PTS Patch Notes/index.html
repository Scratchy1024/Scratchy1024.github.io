<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41  heading_md article-el-h3">C.A.M.P. Pets</div>
<div class="paragraph">Say hello to two new fuzzy friends who will help bring your C.A.M.P, to life! We’re
  excited to bring C.A.M.P. Pets to Fallout 76 starting with a Cat and a Dog. And yes, you can pet them.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">You can find your C.A.M.P. Pet in the newly updated DWELLERS workshop tab and spawn
  them by placing the corresponding spawning furniture for the cat or dog - a cat bed and a doghouse. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Once placed, the animals will follow you around your C.A.M.P., idly walk, sit in their
  furniture and use their own cat scratcher or digging in their doggy bone mound. The latter furniture items
  must be placed before they will use them, and currently are found in the MISC workshop tab. </div>
<div class="paragraph">C.A.M.P. Pets will not follow you in the world - they are just that - a C.A.M.P. pet!
  You cannot have more than one at a time, but you can have one pet and one ally in your C.A.M.P.. They will
  not, however, be available in your Shelter. </div>
<div class="paragraph">To interact with your new friend, walk up to them and press the interaction buttons
  that you see when they are close. "Interact" for Pet Commands, "Customize" for Dress Up, and "Edit Name" to
  call them what you'd like (other players will NOT see your pet's name). </div>
<div class="paragraph">Through Pet Commands you can have them sit, speak, and of course, pet them through an
  emote style window. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Dress up your pet by crafting their collars at the Armor Workbench in the Headwear
  section, then use the "Customize" interaction to place them on your friend. </div>
<div class="paragraph">As well as being a cute dweller in your C.A.M.P., they will also bring you an item
  every so often! This Pet Treasure system allows your fuzzy friend to show their love for you by bringing you
  a little treat! </div>
<div class="miner-note"><strong>Miner Note</strong>: Gifts currently include random 1* legendary gear, 1* legendary
  mods, and 2-5 legendary scrip.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">We hope you enjoy the C.A.M.P. Pet feature as much as we did creating it! </div>
<div class="paragraph">Keep an eye out for more pets in the future! </div>

<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41  heading_md article-el-h3">Mutated Public
  Events Update</div>
<div class="paragraph">We’re making a change to the Mutated Public Events playlist by adding five public
  events each with two mutations to the playlist. </div>
<div class="paragraph">These events are: </div>
<ul>
  <li>Campfire Tales: Volatile and Toxic Blood Mutations</li>
  <li>Free Range: Resilient and Swift-Footed Mutations</li>
  <li>Project Paradise: Active Camouflage and Resilient Mutations</li>
  <li>Beasts of Burden: Freezing Touch and Reflective Mutations</li>
  <li>Safe and Sound: Swift-Focused and Danger Cloud Mutations</li>

<div class="paragraph">During the PTS, these events will be on rotation so that you can provide us feedback on
  all these events. </div>

<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41  heading_md article-el-h3">Perks Update</div>
<div class="paragraph">During Milepost Zero PTS testing and release, we made some focused changes to
  Vaccinated, Iron Stomach, Thirst Quencher, and Natural Resistance perks to make these generally
  underperforming cards more interesting and easier to incorporate into your builds. We did this by removing
  the extra ranks, lowering the cards cost, and changing the card’s effect to scale with the related primary
  stat. </div>
<div class="paragraph">In today’s PTS update, we’re continuing this process by modifying more Perk cards with
  the same design goals in mind. This batch of changes primarily focuses on Endurance cards, but you’ll also
  see some changes to a few cards in the other stat categories. </div>

<div class="paragraph">We’ve reduced the radius in which screen flash effects appear for a multitude of explosions

  Please be sure to provide feedback on whether these changes are sufficient in reducing unwanted screen flashing,

    <ul>
      <li>Dev Note: Alongside the other Empath bugs, this was causing a 33% reduction in all damage taken and a

<div class="paragraph">These enemies previously shared weapons with players and now use enemy-specific variants of
  those
  weapons. As a result, these weapons can no-longer be looted after those enemies are killed. To make up for the
  loss of
  these items, we’ll be making adjustments to creature loot and scrap-to-learn chance for non-legendary mods in a
  later
  update during this PTS. </div>
<div class="paragraph">The types of health, damage, and resistance adjustments mentioned in the creatures below have
  also been applied to other creatures as part of earlier updates. We’ve included additional information here to
  help
  provide a better understanding of the changes being made. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Balance adjustments have been made for the following creatures: </div>
<ul>
  <li>All creatures previously using player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners, Raiders, Scorched,
    Super
    Mutants):
    <ul>
      <li>Weapon damage now scales to level 100.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: As these creatures previously used player weapons, their damage would only
            scale to level 45 or 50.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Thrown grenades now scale with level.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: This currently only applies to enemies using grenades. Damage from player
            grenades is unchanged.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Health, resistances, and damage now scale more smoothly from level 1 to level 100.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: These creatures will generally be less threatening at mid-level (especially
            35-75) but should be a bit tougher towards level 100. In some cases at lower level, these creatures may
            be
            slightly weaker or stronger in order to ensure that they’re appropriately engaging even when first met.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Power Armor variants’ resistances now scale more appropriately at differing levels.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: These creatures previously would gain a flat bonus from Power Armor at all
            levels and thus could be unexpectedly tough at low-to-mid level.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Resistances differentiated between Blood Eagles, Cultists, and Raiders.</li>
      <li>Now relies more on health as the primary driver of survivability rather than resistances.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: Resistances are being used to differentiate damage types rather than as a
            substitute for health. This has the side benefit of showing higher damage numbers when attacking these
            creatures which more closely match the weapons being used.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>No-longer gains a variable amount of resistances based on randomized armor.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Floater Freezer
    <ul>
      <li>Slightly lowered the duration of the slow effect on the freezing breath attack.</li>
      <li>Reduced the rate at which the slow effect accumulates for the freezing breath attack.</li>
      <li>Reduced damage for the freezing breath attack.</li>
      <li>Reduced the cryo damage for the blast/stare/shockwave attack (the one which also deals fusion core
        damage).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Floater Flamer
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced damage for the fire breath attack.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Floater gnasher
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced damage for the bite attack.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Alien Invader
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced health</li>
      <li>Reduced damage in Daily Ops.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lesser Devil
    <ul>
      <li>Increased damage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bloodbug
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced radiation damage at lower levels.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class="paragraph">Magazines </div>
<div class="paragraph">The following Magazines have been updated. For the most part, these are direct increases to
  the
  Magazines’ effects. </div>
<ul>
  <li>Astoundingly Awesome Tales 7: +25 max AP, up from +5.</li>
  <li>Astoundingly Awesome Tales 10: +35% more damage with scoped weapons while aiming, previously +15% without
    needing
    to aim.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: This magazine now specifically offers its benefit to weapons fired using manual
        aim
        and does not affect VATS.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Backwoodsman 2: Name and cover art updated to match effect.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: This is a purely cosmetic change for the magazine’s name and cover. It was
        previously swapped with Backwoodsman 7 (see below).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Backwoodsman 6: Now only affects healing from cooked foods, rather than all effects from cooked food.</li>
  <li>Backwoodsman 7 (name and cover art updated to match effect): Now affects all thrown weapons (Sheepsquatch
    Shard,
    Tomahawk, Throwing Knife, Meat Cleaver) instead of just Tomahawks.</li>
  <li>Live and Love 1: +25 max HP while on a team, up from 10.</li>
  <li>Live and Love 3: Now only affects healing from fruits &amp; veggies, rather than all effects from fruits &amp;
    veggies.</li>
  <li>Live and Love 6: +25 damage resistance while on a team, up from 10.</li>
  <li>Grognak the Barbarian 3: +25 poison resistance, up from 15.</li>
  <li>Grognak the Barbarian 8: +25 cryo resistance (Charisma no-longer required), instead of +2 damage resistance
    per
    point of Charisma.</li>
  <li>Grognak the Barbarian 9: +25 carry weight, up from +10.</li>
  <li>Grognak the Barbarian 10: +25 energy resistance, up from +15.</li>
  <li>Tesla Science 6: +75 radiation resistance, up from +15.</li>
  <li>Guns and Bullets 6: +75 damage resistance at night, up from +10 damage resistance at night.
    <ul>
      <li>Now occurs slightly later at night to match Nocturnal and other night-time effects.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Scout's Life 3: Now reduces all items' weight by 10%, instead of +10 carry weight.</li>
  <li>Scout's Life 9: Now provides +25 fire resistance, instead of -80% camp placement cost.</li>
  <li>US Covert operations Manual 1: +50 damage resistance while sneaking, up from +10 while sneaking.</li>
</ul>
<div class="paragraph">Backwoodsman 6 and Live and Love 3 far exceeded the intended level of benefit for magazines
  and
  have been adjusted to match their original effect of boosting Healing from food items. Backwoodsman 6’s prior
  change
  in the Once in a Blue Moon update had been made in error, and we apologize for the confusion. </div>
<div class="paragraph">Prior to this update, these magazines boosted all foods effects, including (but not limited)
  to
  Carry Weight, S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats, VATS Critical Attack damage, etc. </div>
<div class="paragraph">The effects of these magazines will be further adjusted if needed in future updates. </div>
<div class="bnetArticle-bnetArticle38 bnetArticle-bnetArticle41  heading_md article-el-h3">Bugfixes &amp;
  Miscellaneous
  Adjustments</div>
<ul>
  <li>Addressed an issue where Super Mutant Suiciders wouldn't drop mini-nukes. They now have a small chance to drop
    a
    mini-nuke when killed without exploding.</li>
  <li>Addressed an issue where the Health and Resistances for the Scorchbeast Queen, Ultracite Titan, and Wendigo
    Colossus/Earle weren’t using updated values.</li>
  <li>Addressed an issue where Shotgun durability was much higher than expected as a result of an <a

      change</a>.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: Shotguns previously would lose durability per-pellet instead of per-shot, and
        shotgun durability had not yet been updated to match the much-lower durability impact after the change.
        Please
        be sure to provide feedback on this change, especially if you feel that Shotguns no-longer have durability
        that’s comparable to other weapons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Addressed an issue where NPCs using Laser Rifles can occasionally deal unexpectedly high damage.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: This occurred when those NPCs were using Laser Rifles with Sniper barrels which
        will charge over time when not being fired in order to deal more damage on the next shot. These mods have
        been
        removed from NPC-specific Laser Rifles.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Addressed an issue where Tormentor perk had no effect for automatic weapons.</li>
  <li>Addressed an issue where weapons other than Shotguns could be affected by the Enforcer perk in specific
    circumstances.</li>
  <div class="miner-note"><strong>Miner Note</strong>: Thrown weapons would benefit because <div class="formID">Enforcer
