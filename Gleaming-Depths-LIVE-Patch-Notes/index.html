        <h3 id="thegleamingdepths">The Gleaming Depths</h3>
        <p>The Gleaming Depths raid is a new endgame activity designed to be faced by a party of four highly
            leveled and geared players. Each encounter will require your party to work together to overcome
            unique coop mechanics to overcome the bosses within. These bosses may also punish some types of
            character builds and we’re sure you’ll figure out which builds are more advantageous for each fight.
        </p>
        <p>Unlike Daily Ops and Expeditions, which can be cleared solo if you have the correct build, the
            Gleaming Depths will require you and your squad to take on unique roles during the encounters and
            communicate with each other. To help facilitate communication, we’re also introducing a contextual
            Ping system to allow those who may not feel comfortable with being on voice comms to assist the
            team. When pointed towards a target, the ping system will mark hostile and friendly targets, points
            of interest, and containers.</p>
        <p>When designing this activity, the team laid out five core features that will make raids different
            than other repeatable content:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Require Teamwork</li>
            <li>Challenge Endgame Builds</li>
            <li>Unique Boss Fights</li>
            <li>No Time Gating</li>
            <li>High Value Rewards</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We’ve covered the first three bullet points in the opening paragraphs so now let’s cover the last
            two. </p>
        <p>No time gating. Raids can be completed back-to-back without having to wait for a reset timer. If you
            complete the raid, you get rewards. This is important because completing raid encounters will be
            your primary source of 4-Star Legendary Mods/Items as well as other raid related rewards (such as
            the new Player Titles!).</p>
        <p>A reminder before you go: The Gleaming Depths is intended to be challenging. A part of that challenge
            will be staying alive because your team will not be able to revive you until the encounter is
            finished (in success we hope). Don’t worry though! You can use your downtime to view the fight from
            your teammates perspective which will hopefully allow you to devise a new strategy.<br>
            Also, make sure you utilize the new Raid Public Team before entering the raid. This will give your
            team a Weapon Durability buff that will only work in the Gleaming Depths. </p>
        <h3 id="4starlegendaryitems">4-Star Legendary Items</h3>
        <p>With the release of the Gleaming Depths, we are expanding the current legendary system to take your
            3-Star items and allow you turn them into 4-Star items. Opening a whole new avenue for you to modify
            your weapons and armor in ways that amplify your playstyle. These 4-Star Legendary items will be
            obtainable as drops during the raid.</p>
        <p>To give you an idea of the new mods that await you, here’s a 4-Star Legendary mod from the Weapon,
            Power Armor, and Armors category: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>4-Star Legendary Weapon Effect: Critical Hits Restore 5% of Health &amp; Action Points for
                Player and Teammates Within a 50ft Radius</li>
            <li>4-Star Legendary Power Armor Effect: Action Point Cost of V.A.T.S. Attacks Reduced by -5% (up to
                -25% on Full Stack)</li>
            <li>4-Star Legendary Armor Effect: Melee Weapons Deal +5% Bonus Damage (up to +25% on Full Stack)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This all ties into the Legendary Crafting system that was introduced in Milepost Zero. If you have
            4-Star Legendary Weapons and Armor, you’ll have a chance at obtaining a loose mod or learning the
            recipe when you scrap the item. Like 3-Star Mods, loose 4-Star Mods can be traded with other
            players. But the second you craft it on an item that item becomes untradeable and you cannot drop
            it. </p>
        <h3 id="camppets">C.A.M.P. Pets</h3>
        <p>Say hello to two new fuzzy friends who will help bring your C.A.M.P. to life! We’re excited to bring
            C.A.M.P. Pets to Fallout 76 starting with a Cat and a Dog. And yes, you can pet them.</p>
        <p>You can find your C.A.M.P. Pet in the newly updated DWELLERS workshop tab and spawn them by placing
            the corresponding spawning furniture for the cat or dog - a cat bed and a doghouse. </p>
        <p>Once placed, the animals will follow you around your C.A.M.P., idly walk, sit in their furniture and
            use their own cat scratcher or dig in their doggy bone mound (aka dirt pile). The latter furniture
            items must be placed before they will use them, and currently are found in the MISC workshop tab.
        </p>
        <p>C.A.M.P. Pets will not follow you in the world - they are just that - a C.A.M.P. pet! You cannot have
            more than one at a time, but you can have one pet and one ally in your C.A.M.P.. They will not,
            however, be available in your Shelter.</p>
        <p>To interact with your new friend, walk up to them and press the interaction buttons that you see when
            they are close. "Interact" for Pet Commands, "Customize" for Dress Up, and "Edit Name" to call them
            what you'd like (other players will NOT see your pet's name).</p>
        <p>Through Pet Commands you can have them sit, speak, and of course, pet them through an emote style
            window.</p>
        <p>Dress up your pet by crafting their collars at the Armor Workbench in the Pet Clothing section, then
            use the "Customize" interaction to place them on your friend. </p>
        <p>As well as being a cute dweller in your C.A.M.P., they will also bring you an item every so often!
            This Pet Treasure system allows your fuzzy friend to show their love for you by bringing you a
            little treat! </p>
        <p>We hope you enjoy the C.A.M.P. Pet feature as much as we did creating it! <br>
            Keep an eye out for more pets in the future! </p>
        <h3 id="playertitles">Player Titles</h3>
        <p>Player Titles are a new way to express what’s unique about your Vault Dweller. Through your Pip-Boy,
            you can combine different prefixes and suffixes to come up with a nickname that suits you! Earnable
            from participating in Public Events, Limited Time Events, completing Main Quests, and Seasons, these
            unique titles will help you stand out from the crowd. The Gleaming Depths raid will also have its
            own set of titles that will be tied to Challenges. </p>
        <p>For long-time players, any titles that are associated to content that you’ve already completed will
            be automatically granted to your account.</p>

        <p>The release of The Gleaming Depths update marks the start of Season 19 - The Scientific Forge. Themed
            around the paramilitary organization the Enclave, once known as a deep-state faction of the United
            States government, comprised mostly of our favorite artificially intelligent supercomputer,
            M.O.D.U.S. The Enclave’s mission? The revitalization of America through the power of science! </p>

        <h3 id="perkcardsbalancingupdate">Perk Cards Balancing Update</h3>
        <p>The Gleaming Depths update releases with some substantial balancing changes to a handful of Perk
            Cards. </p>
        <p>Our goal was to take generally underperforming perks and make them more interesting and easier to
            incorporate into your builds by removing some extra ranks, lowering the cost, and changing their
            effect to scale with the related primary stat.</p>

        <h3 id="adjustmentstoexplosionvfx">Adjustments to Explosion VFX</h3>
        <p>We’ve reduced the radius in which screen flash effects appear for a multitude of explosions
            throughout the game. This is purely a visual change and does not impact the radius in which damage
            is dealt.</p>
        <p>A few of these have had sizeable reductions (especially Fatman and Fatman MIRV explosions). Please be
            sure to provide feedback on whether these changes are sufficient in reducing unwanted screen
            flashing, if there’s any additional explosions that we should adjust, or if some explosions
            no-longer feel impactful and satisfying to use.</p>

        <p>While these weapons are still being evaluated for overall balance, these particular mods over-shot
            the current target for fire damage mods (especially when taking into account the recent adjustments
            to creature health and resistances) and are being brought in line with similar mods for other
            weapons. This allows for more consistency among weapons and mods when making future changes.</p>
        <h4 id="humanishcreatureweaponbalance">Human(ish) Creature &amp; Weapon Balance</h4>
        <p>Creatures that previously used player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners, Raiders,
            Scorched, and Super Mutants) will now use NPC versions of their weapons with balance adjustments to
            account for this change (see notes below). </p>
        <p>When defeated these enemies will have a chance to drop the base version of their weapon alongside
            some junk items. When a weapon isn’t dropped, the enemy will instead drop more junk items that
            players can scrap to make up for the loss components you would receive from scrapping these weapons.
            Increases have also been made to the components earned from scrapping many junk items in the world,
            so now you will also have more components at your disposal. </p>
        <p>We have also increased the rate at which you learn mods from scrapping weapons by 10% to account for
            the lower number of weapons you’ll find from these NPCs. This increase will not affect your chance
            to learn Legendary weapon mods.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All creatures previously using player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners,
                Raiders, Scorched, Super Mutants):</li>
            <li>Weapon damage now scales to level 100.<ul>
                    <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: This brings these enemy types in line with other creatures
                        whose attacks already could scale to level 100. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Thrown grenades now scale with level.<ul>
                    <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: This currently only applies to enemies using grenades. Damage
                        from player grenades is unchanged.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Health, resistances, and damage now scale more smoothly from level 1 to level 100.<ul>
                    <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: These creatures will generally be less threatening at
                        mid-level (especially 35-75) but should be a bit tougher towards level 100. In some
                        cases, at lower level, these creatures may be slightly weaker or stronger in order to
                        ensure that they’re appropriately engaging even when first met.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Power Armor variants’ resistances now scale more appropriately at differing levels.<ul>
                    <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: These creatures previously would gain a flat bonus from Power
                        Armor at all levels and thus could be unexpectedly tough at low-to-mid level.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Resistances differentiated between Blood Eagles, Cultists, and Raiders.</li>
            <li>Now rely more on health as the primary driver of survivability rather than resistances.<ul>
                    <li><strong>Dev Note</strong>: Resistances are being used to differentiate damage types
                        rather than as a substitute for health. This has the side benefit of showing higher
                        damage numbers when attacking these creatures which more closely match the weapons being
                        used.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>No-longer gains a variable amount of resistances based on randomized armor.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="creaturebalance">Creature Balance</h4>
        <p>The types of health, damage, and resistance adjustments mentioned in the creatures below have also
            been applied to other creatures as part of earlier updates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Floater Freezer</li>
            <li>Slightly lowered the duration of the slow effect on the freezing breath attack.</li>
            <li>Reduced the rate at which the slow effect accumulates for the freezing breath attack.</li>
            <li>Reduced damage for the freezing breath attack.</li>
            <li>Reduced the cryo damage for the blast/stare/shockwave attack (the one which also deals fusion
                core damage).</li>
            <li>Floater Flamer</li>
            <li>Reduced damage for the fire breath attack.</li>
            <li>Floater gnasher</li>
            <li>Reduced damage for the bite attack.</li>
            <li>Alien Invader</li>
            <li>Reduced health</li>
            <li>Reduced damage in Daily Ops.</li>
            <li>Lesser Devil</li>
            <li>Increased damage.</li>
            <li>Bloodbug</li>
            <li>Reduced radiation damage at lower levels.</li>
            <li>Thrasher</li>
            <li>Increased melee attack damage especially at higher levels.</li>
            <li>Decreased Sonic Gobble attack damage at lower levels.</li>
            <li>Now weakest to fire damage and resistant to radiation, energy, and poison damage</li>
            <li>Reduced the bonus damage on most creatures’ weak points from 2.0x to 1.5x. </li>
            <li>Health for body parts generally associated with benefits for crippling limbs has been reduced.
                In many cases, it should be much easier to cripple a creature's limb before dealing enough
                damage to kill the creature.</li>
            <li>Damage to combat inhibitors for robots and turrets will result in less overall health damage to
                the robot, but the combat inhibitor can now be destroyed much earlier, before the robot/turret
                has lost most of its health.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
        <p>When you enter the game for the first time, you’ll be presented with the Accessibility Menu that
            includes the new settings you see below. This will only appear once and if you need to change any of
            these settings in the future, go to Settings &gt; Accessibility.</p>
        <p><strong>Speech-to-Text</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Turning Speech-to-Text ON will add a new message window to the UI that will transcribe all voice
                communication from other players in the area.</li>
            <li>Message Window Fade Time – Changes how long the message window stays on screen after the last
                message has been received.</li>
            <li>Message Window Visibility – Changes the transparency of the message window.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Screen Narration</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>When the setting is ON, you’ll hear the audible description of emotes from other players in the
                area. For example: “[Player] wants to team up!”</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>UI Navigation</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Digital Input</li>
            <li>Several screens relied completely on analog stick input and that has been addressed to allow
                keyboard control on PCs and d-pad control on consoles. This includes the Challenges, Scoreboard,
                Map, and Character Creation screens.</li>
            <li>Analog Input</li>
            <li>Several screens didn’t support analog inputs to navigate the UI, so that analog functionality
                has been added to the Favorites Wheel and Social Panel.</li>
            <li>Single Key Presses</li>
            <li>Fast Travel Countdown Cancel – Now allows a single button command to cancel the fast travel
                instead of clicking both the left and right analog sticks.</li>
            <li>Social Menu – Allows a single button command to enter the Social Menu instead of having to hold
                CTRL-TAB on PC.</li>
        </ul>
